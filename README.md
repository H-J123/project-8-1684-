This project, titled “Software Defect Prediction Using Lyrebird Optimization Algorithm with Machine Learning Classifiers,” is implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, typically run in environments like VS Code or Google Colab on Windows or Linux systems. It uses four machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB)—combined with the Lyrebird Optimization Algorithm (LOA), which acts as a meta-heuristic optimizer for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning on NASA PROMISE software defect datasets such as PC1, PC4, KC2, KC3, and MC1. The main purpose of the project is to build an efficient framework that predicts whether software modules are defective or non-defective at an early stage, by selecting the most relevant software metrics and improving classifier performance; this aims to enhance software reliability, reduce maintenance costs, and support better software quality assurance in real-world development environments
